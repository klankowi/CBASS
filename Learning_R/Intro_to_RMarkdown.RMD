## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To make this work, you need to download a separate software called MikTex. Please follow the instructions here:
<https://webpages.uidaho.edu/~renaes/419/Handouts/R%20markdown%20prep.pdf>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Look very closely at the way the code chunk is written in the text editor. Everything is important here. You need three _accent_ signs, the squiggly brackets, and _r_ written to begin a code chunk, then you end the code chunk with a second set of _accent_ signs. The code chunk also has the word _cars_, this is simply the name of the chunk. You should name chunks something that indicates their purpose.

If you want a code chunk to accomplish a task but DO NOT want the actual code to be repeated in the compiled report, you can use the following syntax:

```{r hidecode, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

If you wrote a code chunk that you do not think you actually need and do not need to run, but want to keep just in case, use the following syntax to suppress both the evaluation of the chunk:

```{r donotrun, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can use both _echo_ and _eval_ for a single chunk to essentially make it disappear from all output.

```{r hideentirely, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Loading data

Loading data occurs the same way in RMarkdown as it does for regular R scripts. We will be working with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States. Respondends are asked about their diet and physical activity, HIV/AIDs status, tobacco use, and healthcare coverage. We will use a random sample of 20,000 people pulled from this dataset. I have saved this as a CSV file in our GitHub repository, which we can download at will.

```{r loaddata}
setwd(here("Learning_R"))
cdc <- read.csv("cdc.csv")
```

## Summaries

Let's go over some of the concepts we learned about last week, starting with a brief summary of the data.

```{r datasummary, echo=FALSE}
# Top 6 lines of the dataframe
head(cdc)

# Mean, median, and variance of weight
mean(cdc$weight)
median(cdc$weight)
var(cdc$weight)

```

\newpage

## Tables
 
We can determine the number of respondents who smoke using a table, like this. In this dataset, 0 represents non-smokers and 1 represents smokers.

```{r smokertable}
table(cdc$smoke100)

```

Let's say we want to look at the proportion of smokers to non-smokers. This would be equal to dividing the number of smokers by the population size (20,000 respondents) and the number of non-smokers by the population size. 

```{r relfreq}
table(cdc$smoke100) / nrow(cdc)
```

If we want to show the breakdown of smokers by gender, we can make a two-way table.
```{r twoway-table}
table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100)
```

\newpage

## Plots

We can turn this information into a barplot. RMarkdown is a great tool for data visualization. It easily embeds plots into your output.
```{r barplot}
barplot(table(cdc$smoke100))
```

\newpage

Let's visualize the relationship between gender and smoking. This would make for a great mosaic plot, in which we can check the relative frequency of a dependent variable (smoking) among different categorical variables (gender)
```{r mosaicplot}
mosaicplot(table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100))
```

\newpage

## Quantitative data

So far, we have worked on categorical data (gender, yes or no to smoking). Let's dig in to some quantitative stuff. We can make box-and-whisker plots using the quantitative data of respondent height.

```{r boxplots}
boxplot(cdc$height)
```

\newpage

We can break this into categories, as well.

```{r boxplot-gender}
boxplot(cdc$height ~ cdc$gender)
```

\newpage

We can also make a histogram of respondent height
```{r histogram}
hist(cdc$height)
```

\newpage

Or a scatterplot of respondent height vs. weight
```{r scatterplot}
plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight)
```

## Saving and getting output

Once you're done editing the markdown document, you can save it normally. You can also "knit" it to get a nice document showing all your work and output. Click the "Knit" button above, and you'll see the "Render" tab in the console become active. RStudio will then work with MikTex to create whatever kind of document you have specified (html, pdf, or microsoft word). You can then navigate to your working directory and view the output.
